        Mouse Positions are very important in big projects like games , server , web based os etc . These also can be used when creating an another scripting language . Mouse positions are really widely used in every 3d games and apps . Mouse has 2 axis x and y , x axis shows horizontal mouse positions and y aixs shows vertical mouse positions .

        uuid stands for Universally Unique IDentifier . uuid is a unique collection of texts with (-) sign . all uuid's are different means if a uuid has been created so another uuid will be different not be same . means a uuid created is unique and rare . uuid's can be used any where most commonly uuid's are used in minecraft bedrock and pocked edition resource packs . uuid's are free to generate and use you can generate a uuid with the help of a tool or with the help of a programming language .

        For creating uuid with the help of operating syste api you need to use uuid object with it's methods . syntax is uuid.[method] . there is only 1 method of uuid object which is create() method so for creating a uuid with operating syste js api you can write uuid.create(); this will generate many uuid as per demand . Here's a basic example for you understanding <br><br>
        
        <div class="code">
          <br>
          // this code will generate infinite uuid as page refresh <br><br>

For using int() function you can use as you want , means use this anywhere in the program we suggest to create a variable name and store int() inside that . int takes only 1 argument which is the strinbg variable in which the numbers are stored , like there is a variable a in which numbers are storen in the form of string so i can create a another variable with another name suppose i created a variable b so inside b i will write int() function and inside int i will write a for convert a into number then i can use b as for any numerical operations . for explanation here's a program . <br><br>

<div class="code"><br>
  var a = "1234";<br><br>
  
  var b = int(a);<br><br>
  
  alert(b + 9);<br>

Here's a brief code for you to understand . <br><br>
      
      <div class="code">

Here's a example code that shows how to use cache .

        For using install() function of operating syste js api you can write install([args]) . args stands for arguments and install() function currently has only 1 argument list which install all js api available on foz dtx library . for example i want to install all api available on foz dtx library so i will write install(list); note that install() function also uses cache so before using install function you need to create a cache else you will got errors . Here's a code which will help you to understand install function perfectly . <br><br>

        install(list);<br>
      </div>
